Note: all git commands start with git

go to github.com and create an account.

Once done open a text file (on your desktop) to keep the following details so that you can remember them and its easier to follow.


save your email username and password in your text file.
For example:

USERNAME:
your_user_name

PASSWORD:
your_password



Back to github...
on github create a new repository
(on top of page beside username the + icon => New repository)
or once logged in paste this to your address bar: https://github.com/new

for Repository name:

call it something unique and use underscores for spaces and NO /// slashes

example: my_first_git_repo

add a description for it 

ensure that you select: Initialize this repository with a README radio button

(optional) add a license if you want to just add MIT License

(optional) GitIgnore
Note: GitIgnore allows you to specify which files or type of files you want your repository to ignore -literally :-)

Select Create repository (green button)

this opens your new repository 

copy the link to this from the task bar and save to your text document.

for example: https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repository_name

for example:
USERNAME:
your_user_name

PASSWORD:
your_password

PULL:
https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repository_name

ORIGIN:
https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repository_name.git

You will need this information soon so keep your text file open and minimise your browser.

BACK TO cmd shell

in the shell you can see the path you are in for example:

C:\Documents and Settings\Owner>

the locations in this path will ALWAYS be different so for us we want to navigate up to the root of the C:\ drive like so:

type-> 
cd .. 
and press enter

repeat this until you are at C:\>

Note: Pressing the up arrow key will allow you to use commands that you already entered

type->MKDIR first

Note: first is the name of a folder and MKDIR is create a directory

For a moment go to your c drive and you will now see a folder called first there.

Back to cmd
type-> 
cd /first

your path now is:

C:\first>

type-> 
git init

this creates/initialises a local repository.

Response would be:
Initialized empty GIT repository in C:/first/.git/

Now we set up some GLOBAL attributes note you will do this only once:

keep your text file open for reference

at the cmd:

type->
git config --global user.name "Your_User_Name"

type->
git config --global user.email "Your_User_Email"

type->
git config --global core.autocrlf false 

type->
git config --global core.safecrlf true 

type->
git pull https//github.com/your_user_name/your_repository_name

you have now connected your local repository to your on line one

to check have a look inside the first folder and you should see a README.md file

while you are in this folder create a new text file and name it.

back to cmd

type->
git status

this returns the files that have been added and or modified

type->
git add "the_name_of_the_file_you_just_created.txt"

this is referred to as staging your files so to complete...

for the next step ensure you use quotes “” and the .git at the end like so:
type->
git remote add origin "https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repository_name.git"


the next is to say to git yes I want to use these files and send them up to the server.  Please ensure you use a comment in quotes “” as in the example below. This is a note on what you are doing.

Type->
git commit -m "My first commit"

type->
git push origin master

wait.....

1st response enter your username
type->
your_user_name
2nd response enter your password
type->
your_password

Note: the password will not show up as you type it

you should get a response that has no errors

go to your browser and on the git page refresh and your file is up there on line.
